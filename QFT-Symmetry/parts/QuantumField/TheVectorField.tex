Since the Largaran of the eletromagnetic field is:
\[\mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}\]
so we can easily compute the quantity(which is myself defined):
\[\pi^{\mu\nu}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_{\nu} A_\mu)}=F^{\mu\nu}\]
which implies the conjugate monmentum to $A_0$ is:
\[\pi^0=\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_{0} A_0}=F^{00}=0\]
so the standard quantilization is not working here\par
to make a trick, we can use a new largrange:
\[\mathcal{L}=-\frac{1}{4}F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}-\frac{\xi}{2}(\partial^\mu A_\mu)^2\]
which is the same as before in lorentz gauge:$\partial^\mu A_\mu=0$.\par
in such a form, the quantity as before defined is become:
\[\pi^{\mu\nu}=\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_{\nu} A_\mu)}=F^{\mu\nu}-\xi\eta^{\mu\nu}(\partial^\sigma A_\sigma)\]
so at this time we have conjugate monmentum about the zero component:
\[\pi^0=\frac{\partial L}{\partial (\partial_{0} A_0})=-\xi\partial^\sigma A_\sigma=-\xi \partial\bullet A\]
from this formula ,it is clearly to see that if we want to quantelize the eletromagnetic field from the standard procedure ,the lorentz gauge is not working.\par
and the motion equation is :
\[\partial^2 A_\mu-(1-\xi)\partial_\mu(\partial\bullet A)=0\]
so when we choose $\xi=1$ which called the Feymann Gauge,the motion equation is just the same as the classic wavefunction:\par
\[A_\mu(x)=\int\frac{d^3 p}{(2\pi)^3}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2E_p}}\sum_{\lambda=0}^3(a_p^{(\lambda)}\epsilon_\mu^{(\lambda)}(p)e^{-ipx}+a_p^{(\lambda)\dagger}\epsilon_\mu^{(\lambda)*}(p)e^{ipx})\]
where symbol $\lambda$ denote the polarization of the photon.\par
\subsection{convention for the polarization vector}
first we have p fixed,and we randomly choose a unit vector n which satisfy $n^0>0$.at this time we have two vectors fixed.we choose vector $\epsilon^{(1),(2)}$ that in the plane which is vertical to the n and p and satisfying:
\[\epsilon^{\lambda}(p)\bullet \epsilon^{\lambda'*}(p)=-\delta_{\lambda,\lambda'} , with \lambda,\lambda'=1,2\]
we choose $\epsilon^3(p)$ in the plane which n and p located and make it vertical to n and is unit:
\[\epsilon^3(p)\bullet n=0, (\epsilon^3(p))^2=-1\]
to sommerize we have the relations in our convention:
\[\sum_{\lambda}\frac{\epsilon_\mu^\lambda(p)\epsilon_\nu^{\lambda *}(p)}{\epsilon^\lambda(p)\bullet\epsilon^{\lambda*}(p)}=\eta^{\mu\nu}\]
\[\epsilon^\lambda(p)\bullet\epsilon^{\lambda'*}(p)=\eta^{\lambda\lambda'}\]
and the quantilization relation is:
\[[A^\mu(x),\dot{A}^{\nu}]=-i\eta^{\mu\nu}\delta^3(x-y)\]
